            Hi all! Welcome to my profile. </div>

<br>

<p> I'm Yobu working in Sutherland Global Services, Chennai.
</p>
<p>I have completed MCA in 2013 from Dr.SACOE college, Thiruchendur which is near to my hometown "Thoothukudi".
</p>
<p>
  After completing my MCA, I wasted 1 year by going to gym, learning ancient game like Kalari, Silambattam. I got my first job
  in 2014 at Sutherland global services, Chennai. </p>

  <p> I'm working as a Team leader for Amazon process which is nothing related to programming. As I have a little fear about programming, have never tried to attend any interviews on developing.
  </p>
  <p>But after completing this course will definitely change my work towards programming as I love to create applications.
  </p>
  <p> After going through this course, I feel great by learning which Tanmai teaches. Great lessons.</p>
    <h1> Thanks Tanmai<h1>
